# ‚òï Coffee Shop Sales Data Analysis Project

Welcome to the Coffee Shop Sales Data Analysis Project! This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of coffee shop sales data, including data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to uncover insights and trends.

## üìä Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the sales data of a coffee shop to gain insights into sales patterns, peak hours, top-selling products, and more. The analysis is performed using Power Pivot for Excel, and the results are presented through interactive dashboards.

### Dataset

The dataset contains the following columns before cleaning and transformation:

- `transaction_id`: Unique identifier for each transaction
- `transaction_date`: Date of the transaction
- `transaction_time`: Time of the transaction
- `transaction_qty`: Quantity of products in the transaction
- `store_id`: Identifier for the store
- `store_location`: Location of the store
- `product_id`: Identifier for the product
- `unit_price`: Price per unit of the product
- `product_category`: Category of the product (e.g., Coffee, Tea, Bakery)
- `product_type`: Type of product (e.g., Gourmet brewed coffee, Brewed Chai tea)
- `product_detail`: Detailed description of the product

### Data Cleaning and Transformation

The data was cleaned and transformed using Power Pivot for Excel. Here are some of the transformations applied:

- Added a `Size` column to categorize products by size (e.g., Large, Small).
- Calculated `Total` sales for each transaction.
- Extracted and added columns for `Month Name`, `Day Name`, `Hour`, `Day of Week`, and `Month`.

### Insights and Visualizations

The following insights were derived from the analysis and visualized using pivot tables, slicers, and graphs:

- **Peak Sales Hours**: Identified the hours with the highest sales quantity.
- **Monthly and Daily Sales Distribution**: Analyzed sales trends across different months and days.
- **Footfall Across Store Locations**: Examined customer footfall at various store locations.
- **Revenue from Top-Selling Items**: Determined revenue generated by the top 5 most selling items.
- **Sales Distribution by Location**: Compared sales across different store locations.
- **Size Distribution**: Calculated the percentage distribution of different product sizes (Regular, Small, Large, Not Defined).
